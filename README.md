## 📖 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is an End-to-End Machine Learning solution for the **Spaceship Titanic** challenge[cite: 9]. [cite_start]The goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the spaceship's collision with a spacetime anomaly[cite: 14].

[cite_start]Instead of a traditional presentation, this repository serves as the complete documentation, covering **Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Preprocessing**, **Model Training**, **Evaluation**, and **Deployment** via a Streamlit Web App[cite: 108, 93].
